## Challenges
- Using GitHub as a group - updating permissions, navigating branches/accidental forks when pushing changes, merging, etc.
- Ensuring cross-device responsiveness
- Layout/image styling and card animations

## Commit Disparities
- Nhi has the most commits as team leader -- She approved pull requests and did merges throughout the project in addition to pushing changes for her own pages. She did not experience any issues creating a branch or pushing changes.
- Rosy has the least commits due to issues with accidental forks and being unable to push as she went along -- most of her edits were included in a single commit towards the end of the project, but she was working on it and meeting with Nhi and Jordyn over Zoom throughout the project.
- Jordyn also had issues with commits at first but figured it out earlier on and was able to get in a decent number of commits.
- Overall, the work was split pretty evenly, with each team member taking on a page of the website (Nhi - Movies, Jordyn - Credits, and Rosy - Dinosaurs). Once it was clear our fourth member wasn't going to join us, we collaborated on what the homepage should look like and Nhi took that on since we planned to copy and paste the scrolling element from her movies page.
