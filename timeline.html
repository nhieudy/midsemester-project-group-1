              <p class="movies_summary">
                Industrialist John Hammond has created Jurassic Park, a theme
                park of de-extincted dinosaurs, on the tropical island Isla
                Nublar, off the coast of Costa Rica. After a Velociraptor kills
                a dinosaur handler, the park's investors, represented by lawyer
                Donald Gennaro, threaten to pull funding unless experts certify
                the island's safety. Gennaro invites chaotician Ian Malcolm, and
                Hammond invites paleontologist Alan Grant and paleobotanist
                Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see living
                Brachiosaurus and Parasaurolophus. At the park's visitor center,
                the group learns that the cloning was accomplished by extracting
                dinosaur DNA from prehistoric mosquitoes preserved in amber. DNA
                from frogs, among other animals, was used to fill in gaps in the
                dinosaurs' genome.<br /><br />
                To prevent breeding, the dinosaurs were made female by direct
                chromosome manipulation. The group witnesses the hatching of a
                baby Velociraptor and visits the raptor enclosure. During lunch,
                the group debates the ethics of cloning and the park's creation.
                Malcolm warns of the implications of genetic engineering while
                Grant and Sattler express uncertainty over the ability of humans
                and dinosaurs to coexist. Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim,
                join the others for a park tour in two self-driving electric
                Ford Explorer tour vehicles, while Hammond oversees them from
                the control room. Most of the dinosaurs fail to appear, and the
                group encounters a sick Triceratops. The tour is cut short as a
                tropical storm approaches. The park employees leave for the
                mainland on a boat while the visitors return to their
                railed-electric tour vehicles, except Sattler, who stays behind
                with the park's veterinarian, Dr. Harding, to study the
                Triceratops.<br /><br />
                Nedry's sabotage cuts power to the tour vehicles, stranding them
                as they near the park's Tyrannosaurus rex paddock. Most of the
                park's electric fences have also been deactivated, allowing the
                Tyrannosaurus to escape and attack the group. After the
                Tyrannosaurus overturns a tour vehicle, it injures Malcolm and
                devours Gennaro while Grant, Lex, and Tim escape. On his way to
                deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry gets lost in
                the rain, crashes his Jeep Wrangler, and is killed by a
                venom-spitting Dilophosaurus. Sattler helps the game warden
                Robert Muldoon search for survivors; they find Malcolm just
                before the Tyrannosaurus returns and chases them away. Grant,
                Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop and encounter a
                Brachiosaurus herd. They discover the broken shells of dinosaur
                eggs the following morning. Grant concludes that the dinosaurs
                are breeding, which is possible because of amphibian DNAâ€”animals
                like West African frogs can change their sex in a single-sex
                environment, enabling the dinosaurs to breed, proving Malcolm's
                earlier statement that "Life finds a way". The three later
                encounter a Gallimimus stampede being hunted by the
                Tyrannosaurus.<br /><br />
                Unable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security
                system, Hammond and chief engineer Ray Arnold decide to reboot
                the park's systems. The group shuts down the park's power grid
                and retreats to an emergency bunker while Arnold heads to a
                maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold
                fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head over, discovering the
                shutdown has released the Velociraptors. Muldoon distracts two
                of them while Sattler turns the power back on before being
                attacked by a third and discovering Arnold's severed arm. While
                she escapes, Muldoon is caught off-guard and killed by a
                Velociraptor.<br /><br />
                Grant, Tim, and Lex reach the visitor center. Grant heads out to
                look for Sattler, leaving Tim and Lex inside. The raptors appear
                and pursue Tim and Lex throughout a kitchen, but they escape,
                locking one in a freezer before joining Grant and Sattler. The
                group reaches the control room, and Lex restores the park's
                systems, allowing them to contact Hammond, who calls for help.
                As they try to leave, they are cornered by the two remaining
                raptors, but the Tyrannosaurus appears and kills the raptors
                while the group flees. Hammond arrives in a jeep with Malcolm,
                and they board a helicopter to leave the island. Grant and
                Hammond agree not to endorse the park.

              <p class="movies_summary">
                Four years after the events on Isla Nublar,[a] a British family
                anchors their yacht off a beach on Isla Sorna and comes ashore,
                unaware of the genetically engineered dinosaurs on the island.
                Their daughter, Cathy Bowman, wanders off and is attacked by a
                group of Compsognathus. <br /><br />

                Peter Ludlow, nephew of Dr. John Hammond, uses the incident to
                oust Hammond and gain control of InGen. The company's second
                facility, "Site B" on Isla Sorna, was where the dinosaurs were
                cloned, but the island was abandoned during a hurricane several
                years earlier. Ludlow plans to exploit Isla Sorna's dinosaurs to
                save InGen, prompting Hammond to request Dr. Ian Malcolm's help
                in documenting the creatures to promote a non-interference
                policy. Ian's girlfriend, paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding, is
                already on Isla Sorna, leading Ian to reluctantly agree to go,
                but only to retrieve her. <br /><br />

                Ian travels to Isla Sorna with equipment specialist and
                engineer, Eddie Carr, and video documentarian and activist, Nick
                Van Owen. They find Sarah and discover that Ian's daughter Kelly
                has stowed away in their research trailer. Ludlow and a
                mercenary team arrive on the island to capture dinosaurs, with
                help from big-game hunters Roland Tembo and Ajay Sidhu.<br /><br />

                Ian's group realizes that Ludlow intends to ship the captured
                specimens to San Diego for a new Jurassic Park, using a nearly
                finished amphitheater that Hammond abandoned in favor of the
                Isla Nublar site. Nick and Sarah free the captured dinosaurs,
                and the animals wreak havoc on the InGen team's camp. On the way
                back to the trailer, Nick rescues an injured Tyrannosaurus rex
                infant that Roland used as bait to hunt its parent. Knowing this
                will bring the baby's parents to them, Ian takes Kelly to safety
                and returns to the trailer to warn Sarah and Nick. They
                successfully treat the infant, but the Tyrannosaurus parents
                arrive, having tracked the infant's scent. They reclaim their
                infant and destroy the trailer by overturning and pushing it
                partially over the cliff. Eddie arrives and attempts to pull the
                trailer back up, but both Tyrannosaurus return and start tearing
                Eddie's SUV apart before they devour him. <br /><br />

                Ian, Sarah, and Nick are rescued by Ludlow's team and forced to
                work together since both groups lost all their communication
                equipment in separate attacks. They decide to travel to an
                abandoned InGen base to call for help. After the team sets up a
                camp, they are ambushed by the Tyrannosaurus adults. The party
                flees into a field of long grass where a pack of Velociraptors
                ambush them, killing Ajay and most of the team. Ian's group
                reaches the InGen base, fights off the Velociraptors, and
                successfully radios for helicopter extraction. Nick reveals that
                he stole Roland's bullets to prevent him from killing his
                trophy. However, Roland has sedated the male Tyrannosaurus with
                tranquilizers. As InGen personnel arrive to secure the male and
                infant, Roland declines Ludlow's job offer at the San Diego
                park, reflecting on Ajay's death and the morality of Ludlow's
                scheme.<br /><br />

                At the Port of San Diego, Ian and Sarah attempt to convince
                Ludlow to abandon his plans, but the ship carrying the male
                Tyrannosaurus suddenly crashes into the docks. The crew is found
                dead, and the adult is accidentally released and rampages
                throughout the city. Ian and Sarah locate the infant at the
                planned park and use it to lure the adult back to the docks.
                Ludlow tries to retrieve the infant but is killed by the
                dinosaurs. Sarah uses a tranquilizer gun to sedate the male
                before government forces can use lethal force on it, and Ian
                seals the cargo hold doors. <br /><br />

                In the aftermath, the dinosaurs are shipped back to Isla Sorna
                accompanied by the U.S. Navy. Ian, Sarah, and Kelly watch
                Hammond in a televised interview announcing that the American
                and Costa Rican governments have declared the island a nature
                reserve.

                Paleontologist Alan Grant struggles to secure funding for his
                Velociraptor research, where he attempts to prove his hypothesis
                they were intellectually and socially advanced. Instead, he
                finds himself rebuffing the public's obsession with the events
                on Isla Nublar[b] and the InGen incident in San Diego.[c] He
                receives encouragement to continue from his now-married
                ex-girlfriend Ellie Sattler and his assistant Billy Brennan, who
                uses 3D printing to replicate a Velociraptor larynx. Wealthy
                couple Paul and Amanda Kirby offer to fund his research in
                return for a guided aerial tour of Isla Sorna, claiming they
                have permission to fly there.[d]

                Alan reluctantly agrees, flying there with Billy, two of the
                Kirbys' mercenary associates, Udesky and Cooper, and their
                pilot, Nash. When the Kirbys try to have Nash land the plane,

                to find they have landed, and the Kirbys refuse to leave, until
                a Spinosaurus approaches them. They attempt to escape but the
                dinosaur attacks their plane during take-off and kills Cooper.
                The plane crashes in the forest, and the Spinosaurus kills Nash
                and swallows Paul's satellite phone. The survivors flee,
                encountering a Tyrannosaurus, which is promptly defeated by the
                Spinosaurus as the humans escape.<br /><br />

                The Kirbys reveal they are a divorced, middle-class couple
                searching for their son Eric and Amanda's boyfriend Ben
                Hildebrand, who have been missing for eight weeks and were last
                seen illegally parasailing by the island. Government agencies
                declined to help so they deceived Alan to secure his assistance,
                mistakenly believing he had experience on Isla Sorna. The group
                searches for Eric and Ben, finding the latter's corpse attached
                to the parasail near a velociraptor nest. They discover the
                InGen compound, where they are attacked by a pack of
                Velociraptors, who kill Udesky. Alan is separated from the rest
                of the group but is saved from the raptors by Eric, who has been
                sheltering in a supply truck.<br /><br />

                The following morning, Alan and Eric reunite with Billy and
                Eric's parents and narrowly escape the Spinosaurus again. Alan
                finds Billy stole Velociraptor eggs, which resulted in the
                earlier attacks. Billy hoped to sell the eggs to fund their dig
                site, which Alan disapproves of, but keeps the eggs regardless,
                hoping the Velociraptors may spare the group if they are
                returned. The group enters an aviary and is attacked by a flock
                of Pteranodons, one of which takes Eric to its nest to feed him
                to its young; Billy rescues Eric using the parasail but is
                seemingly killed while the rest escape by boat along an adjacent
                river. They retrieve the satellite phone and Grant contacts
                Ellie for help while they are attacked once again by the
                Spinosaurus.<br /><br />

                The following day, the group hears a helicopter overhead and
                arrives at the coast, but are ambushed by the Velociraptors, who
                have come for the eggs. Alan, finding the replicated larynx in
                Billy's bag, uses it to confuse the pack. Upon hearing distant
                helicopters, the raptors reclaim their eggs and retreat. The
                U.S. Marines and Navy, summoned by Ellie, land on the beach and
                rescue the survivors. On a helicopter, they discover that an
                injured Billy has also been rescued. They watch the now-freed
                Pteranodons fly alongside them as they leave the island<br /><br />

              <p class="movies_summary">
                Years after the Jurassic Park disaster on Isla Nublar,[b]
                Masrani Global Corporation acquired InGen's assets and
                eventually opened a new dinosaur theme park on the island known
                as Jurassic World. Brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit the
                park, where their aunt Claire Dearing works as the operations
                manager. She assigns her assistant Zara to guide them, but they
                evade her and explore on their own.
                <br /><br />

                Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady has been training a
                Velociraptor squad composed of Blue, Charlie, Delta and Echo,
                and researching their intelligence. Based on the raptors'
                ability to follow commands, the head of InGen security Vic
                Hoskins believes that the animals can be weaponized, an idea
                Owen and his assistant Barry vehemently oppose.<br /><br />

                Claire and Jurassic World owner Simon Masrani inspect the park's
                newest upcoming attraction, the Indominus rex, a transgenic
                dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. Masrani tasks Owen
                with evaluating the enclosure's security. Owen warns Claire that
                the Indominus lacks social skills, making it dangerous and
                unpredictable. When the Indominus seemingly escapes, Owen and
                two other workers investigate. The dinosaur, capable of
                camouflaging itself and masking its heat signature, suddenly
                appears and devours the other two men, but Owen manages to
                survive. The Indominus escapes its paddock and into the island's
                interior. Owen urges Masrani to destroy it, but Masrani, trying
                to protect his company's investment, sends a unit to subdue it
                using non-lethal weaponry. After the unit is killed, Claire
                orders the northern sector's evacuation while Masrani confronts
                Wu about the Indominus design.<br /><br />

                While exploring the park in a tour vehicle, Zach and Gray enter
                a restricted area. The Indominus arrives and destroys the
                vehicle, but the boys narrowly escape. They find the ruins of
                the original Jurassic Park visitor center, repair an old Jeep
                Wrangler, and drive back to the park resort.<br /><br />

                As Claire and Owen search for the boys, they barely escape the
                Indominus as well. Masrani and two soldiers hunt the Indominus
                by helicopter, but it breaks into the park's aviary. The
                Pteranodons and Dimorphodons, startled by the Indominus, flee
                the aviary and fly into Masrani's helicopter, causing it to
                crash and kill its passengers. The escaped pterosaurs converge
                on the resort and attack everyone, including Zara, who is then
                devoured by a Mosasaurus. Zach and Gray find Owen and Claire at
                the resort as armed personnel shoot down the pterosaurs.<br /><br />

                Hoskins assumes command and orders the raptors to be used to
                track the Indominus, whereupon Owen reluctantly complies and
                spearheads the assault with the raptors. Upon finding it, the
                dinosaurs begin communicating among themselves. Owen realizes
                that the Indominus has Velociraptor DNA, and it usurps Owen's
                command of the raptors, becoming the pack's new alpha. Soldiers
                fire on the Indominus, but it escapes. The raptors slaughter
                most of the soldiers, while Charlie is killed in the chaos.
                Hoskins evacuates Wu and the dinosaur embryos from the island to
                protect his research. Owen, Claire, and the boys find Hoskins at
                the lab securing more embryos, but Delta breaks in and kills
                him.<br /><br />

                Owen restores his bond with the three surviving raptors before
                the Indominus reappears. The raptors attack the hybrid, but
                Delta and Echo are killed while Blue is knocked unconscious.
                Claire releases the Tyrannosaurus rex[c] from its paddock and
                lures it to the Indominus. The dinosaurs attack each other, and
                the Indominus eventually overpowers the Tyrannosaurus, but Blue
                recovers and joins the battle. The duo fights the Indominus
                until it gets cornered at the lagoon's edge, where it is dragged
                underwater by the Mosasaurus. Owen and Blue part ways
                afterwards.<br /><br />

                The survivors are evacuated, and the island is abandoned once
                again. Zach and Gray reunite with their parents, while Owen and
                Claire decide to stay together. <br /><br />

                Six months after the Jurassic World incident and the Indominus
                rex's death,[b] a small mercenary team arrives on the abandoned
                Isla Nublar to collect DNA from its remains in the lagoon. After
                a two-man team collects a bone sample, the Mosasaurus devours
                their submersible. The Tyrannosaurus attacks the team, but the
                surviving members escape with the sample by helicopter. The
                Mosasaurus kills one of the men and swims through the partially
                open underwater gates into the open ocean.
                <br /><br />

                Three years later, a U.S. Senate committee debates whether Isla
                Nublar's dinosaurs should be saved from an impending volcanic
                eruption. Chaotician Dr. Ian Malcolm testifies that the
                dinosaurs should perish naturally to correct the wrongful
                cloning done by John Hammond.<br /><br />

                Meanwhile, Jurassic World's former operations manager, Claire
                Dearing, has established the Dinosaur Protection Group to save
                the animals. After the Senate votes against government
                involvement in rescuing the animals, Hammond's former partner,
                Sir Benjamin Lockwood, invites Claire to his Northern California
                estate. Lockwood and his aide, Eli Mills, reveal a plan to
                relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary. Claire is
                needed to reactivate the park's tracking system to locate the
                animals, particularly Blue, the last surviving Velociraptor. She
                recruits Owen Grady, former Velociraptor trainer, to help
                capture Blue.<br /><br />

                On Isla Nublar, Claire and former park technician Franklin Webb
                reactivate the online tracking system. Owen, paleo-veterinarian
                Zia Rodriguez, and a mercenary team led by Ken Wheatley, track
                and find Blue.<br /><br />

                The encounter escalates, resulting in Blue being shot and
                Wheatley tranquilizing Owen. Wheatley abandons Owen, Claire, and
                Franklin on the island while forcibly taking Zia hostage to
                treat Blue. A volcano eruption begins, causing a massive
                dinosaur stampede and forcing the trio to escape. The ship,
                loaded with captured dinosaurs, departs as the remaining
                dinosaurs are left behind to die in the eruption. The trio
                sneaks aboard the ship and helps Zia transfuse Blue with
                Tyrannosaurus blood to save her life.<br /><br />

                The captured dinosaurs are actually being transported to the
                Lockwood estate, where Lockwood's orphaned granddaughter,
                Maisie, overhears Mills and auctioneer Mr. Eversoll secretly
                planning to sell the dinosaurs on the black market. They will
                also preview the Indoraptor, a weaponized, transgenic dinosaur
                created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu using Indominus rex and
                Velociraptor DNA. Wu needs Blue's DNA to create an improved
                Indoraptor that follows commands, unaware that her blood is no
                longer pure. After Maisie informs Lockwood about the auction, he
                confronts Mills, who smothers him to death with a pillow. Maisie
                is later revealed to have been cloned from Lockwood's deceased
                daughter and the reason why Hammond ended their association.<br /><br />

                The auctioned dinosaurs are being immediately shipped out.
                Franklin evades capture and frees Zia, but Owen and Claire have
                been apprehended. Owen incites a Stygimoloch into breaking open
                their cell. The two encounter Maisie and learn the Indoraptor is
                being sold despite Wu's protests that it is a prototype.<br /><br />

                Owen disrupts the auction by luring the Stygimoloch into the
                room. In the ensuing chaos, Wheatley tranquilizes the Indoraptor
                to extract a tooth as a trophy, but the hybrid, feigning
                unconsciousness, kills him, along with Eversoll and others, as
                it escapes. The Indoraptor chases Owen, Claire, and Maisie
                throughout the mansion until Blue, released by Zia, attacks it.
                After a standoff atop a high glass roof, both animals crash
                through it, killing the Indoraptor by impaling him on a
                ceratopsid skull though Blue is unharmed. When a hydrogen
                cyanide gas leak threatens the caged dinosaurs, Claire attempts
                to free them, by opening the cage doors. Owen convinces her not
                to open the subsequent outer door, but Maisie opens it to save
                them. As Mills attempts to escape with the Indominus rex bone,
                the Tyrannosaurus devours him and tramples the bone. Owen,
                Claire, Maisie, Zia and Franklin escape, while Blue and the
                other released dinosaurs flee the estate grounds. <br /><br />

                In a new U.S. Senate hearing, Dr. Malcolm declares the beginning
                of a new Jurassic period, where humans and dinosaurs must
                coexist. The closing scenes depict the freed dinosaurs roaming
                the wilderness and outer urban areas.

                a blended family from Oakland, California goes on a camping trip
                at the fictional Big Rock National Park in Northern California,
                approximately 20 mi (32 km) from where dinosaurs from Fallen

                protect her from groups seeking to exploit her unique genetic
                makeup.<br /><br />

                When Blue, the Velociraptor Owen raised and trained, arrives at
                the cabin with an asexually-reproduced hatchling, Maisie names
                it Beta. Increasingly frustrated living in seclusion, Maisie
                sneaks away to explore. Mercenaries searching for Maisie find
                and kidnap her and capture Beta.<br /><br />

                Meanwhile, swarms of giant locusts are decimating U.S. crops.
                Dr. Ellie Sattler observes that crops grown with Biosyn seeds
                are left uneaten, raising suspicions that Biosyn created the
                insects. She takes a captured locust to her former romantic
                partner, paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and reveals she is now
                divorced from her husband Mark.[c] They determine the locust was
                genetically engineered with Cretaceous-period and contemporary
                DNA.<br /><br />

                Franklin, now with the CIA's dangerous-species division,
                believes Maisie may have been taken to Malta. Upon arrival
                there, Claire and Owen infiltrate a dinosaur black market with
                Owen's former Jurassic World colleague Barry SembÃ¨ne, who is
                leading a French Intelligence raid. Carnivorous dinosaurs are
                unleashed during the foray, wreaking havoc. When Claire and Owen
                learn that Maisie and Beta were transported to the Biosyn
                facility, sympathetic cargo pilot Kayla Watts agrees to fly them
                there.<br /><br />

                Chaotician Dr. Ian Malcolm now works for Biosyn. He sought
                Ellie's help to expose CEO Dr. Lewis Dodgson after
                communications director Ramsay Cole warned him of Dodgson's
                illegal activities. Dodgson is exploiting dinosaurs and coerces
                former InGen geneticist Dr. Henry Wu to modify the transgenic
                locust to let Biosyn corner the world's food supply. Wu
                denounces the plan, warning it will cause an ecological collapse
                as the locusts spread unchecked.<br /><br />

                Wu meets Maisie and explains that his former colleague, Dr.
                Charlotte Lockwood (Benjamin Lockwood's deceased daughter), used
                her own DNA to replicate and give birth to the genetically
                identical Maisie. She also altered Maisie's DNA to prevent her
                from inheriting the fatal disease which she had. Wu believes
                that Maisie and Beta's asexual conception and DNA are key to
                creating a pathogen to halt the locust outbreak.<br /><br />

                A Quetzalcoatlus attacks Kayla's plane in Biosyn's airspace,
                forcing Owen and Kayla to crash land while Claire is ejected.
                After separate dinosaur encounters, the three regroup. Inside
                Biosyn, Ian and Ramsay covertly advise Ellie and Alan on where
                to obtain a locust DNA sample. While searching for the lab, they
                encounter Maisie. Discovering the breach, Dodgson attempts to
                incinerate the locusts to destroy evidence; some locusts escape
                through an air vent while ablaze, sparking a wildfire around the
                preserve. <br /><br />

                Alan, Ellie, and Maisie barely escape the facility before
                finding Ian. They meet Owen, Claire and Kayla, with Ramsay later
                joining them. Dodgson flees with dinosaur embryos[d] via a
                hyperloop, but becomes trapped after Claire and Ellie reroute
                the power and is then killed by a trio of Dilophosaurus. As the
                group works together, Owen, with Alan and Maisie's help,
                captures Beta. They and Wu escape in a Biosyn helicopter amidst
                a fight between a Giganotosaurus and Isla Nublar's former
                resident Tyrannosaurus,[e] the latter assisted by a
                Therizinosaurus.

                In 2008, seven years after the rescue of Eric Kirby[b] and seven
                years before the Jurassic World incident,[c] InGen uses a
                laboratory on the island of ÃŽle Saint-Hubert in the Atlantic
                Ocean to create transgenetic mutated dinosaurs. One of these
                creations, a deformed six-limbed tyrannosaur dubbed "Distortus
                rex" escapes containment, kills an employee and wreaks havoc,
                forcing the facility personnel to abandon the island.
                <br /><br />

                In the present, five years after the Biosyn incident that caused
                the transgenic locust outbreak,[d] the Earth's climate becomes
                inhospitable to sustain the de-extinct animals. They are forced
                to reside in areas around the equator, which resemble the
                Mesozoic climate, making them marked as no-travel zones.<br /><br />

                Martin Krebs, an executive at pharmaceutical company
                ParkerGenix, recruits Zora Bennett, an ex-military covert
                operative, to collaborate with paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis
                on a top-secret mission. Their goal is to retrieve biomaterial
                samples from the three largest remaining prehistoric specimens,
                which hold the key to a new heart disease treatment. In a bar in
                Suriname, Zora recruits her longtime friend Duncan Kincaid to
                lead the expedition. He brings boat driver LeClerc, mercenary
                Nina, and security chief Bobby Atwater.

                <br /><br />

                The expedition team sets out to ÃŽle Saint-Hubert to extract
                samples from the aquatic Mosasaurus, terrestrial Titanosaurus,
                and avian Quetzalcoatlus. Meanwhile, Reuben Delgado is sailing
                nearby with his daughters Isabella and Teresa, before the latter
                leaves for college. Traveling with them is Teresa's boyfriend
                Xavier Dobbs, whom Reuben finds obnoxious. The family are
                shipwrecked by the Mosasaurus and use a radio to call for help,
                with the expedition team coming to their rescue.<br /><br />

                The team soon encounters the Mosasaurus and extracts a sample
                from it, but the creature returns with a group of Spinosaurus
                and attacks the ship, killing Bobby. Teresa attempts to use the
                radio to call for help, but Martin panics and shoves her away to
                protect the mission's secrecy. Teresa falls overboard after
                Martin refuses to help her. Xavier jumps overboard to rescue
                her, followed by Reuben and Isabella, separating from the
                expedition team. The mosasaur forces the ship aground, and Nina
                is killed onshore by a Spinosaurus. Zora informs the survivors
                that she employed a rescue helicopter to circle the island in 24
                hours.<br /><br />

                The team locates a Titanosaurus herd in a field and easily
                extracts the second sample. Because the Quetzalcoatlus is a
                large and carnivorous animal, the team hopes to avoid issues by
                getting their final sample from an egg instead. Zora, Henry and
                LeClerc rappel to reach the nest, located in an ancient temple
                on the side of a cliff. A parent Quetzalcoatlus returns to the
                nest and devours LeClerc, although Zora and Henry manage to
                escape with the sample.<br /><br />

                Elsewhere on the island, Reuben commends Xavier for rescuing
                Teresa in the water. Xavier survives being attacked by a
                Velociraptor which is subsequently preyed upon by a Mutadon, a
                mutated raptor/pterosaur hybrid. The family searches for the
                InGen complex and encounters various dinosaurs, including an
                Aquilops, whom Isabella adopts and names Dolores. They find a
                raft and, after surviving a Tyrannosaurus rex attack, proceed
                down a river.<br /><br />

                At the complex, the family reunites with the expedition group.
                When Teresa recognizes Martin, he holds the others at gunpoint,
                steals the samples from Zora and flees to the helipad alone by
                UTV. A pack of Mutadons descend on the survivors, who escape
                through underground tunnels.<br /><br />

                The rescue helicopter arrives but is destroyed by the Distortus
                rex, which then devours Martin. The survivors reach a locked
                gate at the end of the tunnel and see a boat on the other side.
                Isabella, small enough to fit through the gate, unlocks it,
                allowing the group to load onto the boat while Duncan diverts
                the D. rex using a flare. Zora, Henry, Reuben, Teresa, Xavier,
                and Isabella escape. Duncan escapes the retreating D. rex and
                joins them. With the samples in hand, Zora and Henry agree to
                distribute the new medication without a patent, making it
                open-source for the entire planet.
